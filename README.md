Mousable
========

Mousable is an Open source AJAX commenting engine (for static web pages,
etc.). It was inspired by http://disqus.com/ but is free and open source
software ( MIT/X11 licence ), and does not require loading JavaScript
resources from Google Analytics, or any other domain.

The name is derived from Catable ( https://github.com/shlomif/catable ),
which stands for “CATAlyst BLog Engine (by Perl cats)”, only with a mouse
instead of a cat. ☺
